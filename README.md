# h2sharp

H2Sharp is an Ado.Net wrapper for the H2 Database Engine written in C#.

H2 is a java relational database engine. 

This project compiles the Jar of H2 with IKVM.Net (program to convert Java Byte code to .Netâ€™s CIL). 

This project wraps the resulting library with classes that implement the ADO.Net interface to allow for easy use in .Net projects. 

As a result the entire system is in CIL (.Net). 

## Use it

We don't publish this package. To use it, you can clone and build it yourself. Specify your the needed h2 version in the csproj file.
